#### [Hierarchical Clustering] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering)


Euclidean distance is what you learned about in high school algebra. Given two points on a plane, (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), the Euclidean
distance is the square root of the sums of the squares of the distances between the two x-coordinates (x1-x2) and the two
y-coordinates (y1-y2). You probably recognize this as an application of the Pythagorean theorem which yields the length of the
 hypotenuse of a right triangle.
